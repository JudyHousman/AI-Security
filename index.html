<li>Would you click this link without hesitation, if I sent it to you?</li>
<li>Alternatively, would most people click on such a link without hesitation, if they got a similarly typical email?</li>
<li>Do you think an AI could go through a hacked email and create plausible emails that were typical of the ones which the victim sent to particular individuals?</li>
</ul>
<p>If so, I would add something like mass personalization to the list of offensive applications of AI.</p>
<p>Probably not worth the cost of development and electricity at this point, but still..Or perhaps it has already been done.</p>
